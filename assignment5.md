# Question 1. What is a problem youâ€™d like to solve using Data Analysis skills?

### In my current research, for my senior thesis I analyzed crystals within volcanic rocks from a specific lava flow on Mt. Baker. I am using a python code called thermobar created by Penny Weiser to use thermobarometry to find temperature and pressure constraints of these specific crystals. 

# Question 2. What kind of computational steps do you think this project would entail?

### I have downloaded the thermobar python code and imported all my data that I have collected. I have made graphs that show the where these minerals have crystallized visually. 

# Question 3. What kind of data would you use?

### I would use my own data that I have collected.
